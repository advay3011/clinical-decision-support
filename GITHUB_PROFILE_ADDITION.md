## 📝 Example Conversation

```
You: my blood pressure is 160 over 90
Agent: That's a little on the high side — are you feeling anything along with it, like headaches or chest tightness?

You: no dizziness or anything
Agent: Good, that's reassuring. Since your pressure is elevated but you're not feeling symptoms, the main things that help day to day are cutting back on salty foods, drinking more water, and try to get some light movement in even just a short walk. Have you checked your blood pressure before or is this a new reading for you?
